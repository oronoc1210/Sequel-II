# Sequel-II
The output of PacBio's new Sequel II platform didn't work with the existing JGI pipeline -- isoseq.py -- written by Jie Guo,
using helper scripts written by PacBio's Elizabeth Tseng.
This was my take at developing a new pipeline for Sequel II data, which still contains some of Jie's code for part of the Post-Processing
steps, and still utilizes Elizabeth's scripts.
